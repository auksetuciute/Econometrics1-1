## YOU CAN PLOT DATA AND MAKE GRAPHS USING R

One of things for which R is most admired is its data visualization capabilities. To the human eye, patterns in data are sometimes difficult to see. Plotting the data helps us see what it’s doing where entering it into a spreadsheet cannot.

Because there are so many kinds of graphs and charts you can do in R and also because I’m tired of writing, I’m only going to address the basic plot() function and show a scatter plot visualisation.

To see visually how Facebook’s stock price correlates with Twitter’s stock price, you can plot them against one another with the plot() function. That gives you the below scatter plot. You get the line from adding the abline() function after the plot has been created.
